# Optimisation dissipative KBF

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for the article:

**Bourahla, N., & Hannachi, A. (2024). Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimization of Dissipative Knee Braced Steel Frames.**  
In A.N. Sigaher, F. Sutcu, & C. Yenidogan (Eds.), *Seismic Isolation, Energy Dissipation, and Active Vibration Control of Structures* (Vol. 412, Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering). Springer, Cham.  
[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-71048-3_12](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-71048-3_12)

The repository focuses on optimizing dissipative Kinematic Beam Frames (KBF) using genetic algorithms (GA) in civil engineering applications, specifically for stability and energy dissipation in seismic design.

## Installation Instructions
To use this repository, clone it using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/abdellatif2/Optimisation_dissipative_KBF
```

Then, install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note**: This project requires SAP2000 version 21 or newer for integration with the optimization algorithms.

## Usage
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` for an interactive approach.
2. Alternatively, you can run the Python script `main.py` for direct execution of the optimization algorithms.

Refer to the comments in the code for further details on the specific methods used.
