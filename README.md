# Optimisation dissipative KBF

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on the optimization of dissipative Kinematic Beam Frames (KBF). 
It explores methods for optimizing these structures in civil engineering applications, with a focus on computational methods for stability and performance.

## Installation Instructions
To use this repository, clone it using the following command:

```
